    <h1>Positioning</h1>

    <p>For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.You can do anything your heart can imagine. In your world you have total and absolute power. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
      <div class="label" id="relative">
        <p>position relative</p>
        <div id="absolute">
          <p>position absolute</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="label" id="fixed">
      <p>position fixed</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.</p>
